# Social Sensei

We created an AI model using OpenAI's API.By prompt engineering this model, we create a model that performs as a social media manager but better. It has the ability to cater to various users and their specific audiences, and has numerous features that users can access. The technologies we used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, OpenAI, and AWS Cloud. In the future we look forward to expanding our model by making it specific to other purposes. We would also like to make it more user friendly by creating more built in functions such as drop down menus and more visual features.
